INSTALLATION
============

Clone the git repo:

git clone git://github.com/simoncadman/CUPS-Cloud-Print.git

cd CUPS-Cloud-Print/
make install

Copy cloudprint.conf.example as /etc/cloudprint.conf , and populate with your own Google details

Restart cups

Add a new printer ( via http://127.0.0.1:631 or usual interface ) as a 'Google Cloud Print' network printer. Select the 'Make' as Google, and 'Model' as Cloud Print.
Supply the connection name as a simple URI pointing to the printer you want to setup, for example:
cloudprint://Print%20to%20Google%20Docs for the Google Docs printer - remembering to URL encode your spaces ( you can find your printers on http://www.google.com/cloudprint ).

Print a test page, to confirm it is working.

Assuming the test page prints correctly, installation is complete.
